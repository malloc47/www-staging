    <header>Building a Personal Dashboard in ClojureScript Part 3</header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>My raison d'Ãªtre for creating the wall-mounted dashboard discussed in
<a href="/building-a-personal-dashboard-in-clojurescript">previous</a> <a href="/building-a-personal-dashboard-in-clojurescript-part-2">posts</a> was to
help with timing my transit connections when leaving my NYC
apartment. After living on my block for a few months, I had worked out
the perfect time to step out the door to make a subway, bus, or ferry
connection, but quickly grew tired of having to pull out my phone to
verify the transit time. I basically wanted an equivalent of the
<a href="https://mta.info/">MTA</a> transit time boards found in most subway stations, customized
with my local stations.</p>
<p>Jumping straight to a sample of the end result, I wanted a dashboard
like this:</p>
<a href="/img/posts/cockpit/transit.png">
  <img src="/img/posts/cockpit/transit.png" alt="Sample transit card" width="400" />
</a>
<p>Building this view, however, is less simple than it sounds. A big part
of the complexity is in finding and consuming a source for the transit
departure times. Unlike the <a href="/building-a-personal-dashboard-in-clojurescript-part-2">weather card</a>,
there isn't a single, free, purpose-built API to serve such
dashboards. To deal with transit, we have to solve two main
challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finding a source for the transit data we need to display on the
dashboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consuming transit data from the above source, stitching it together
to populate the view.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For narrative reasons, we'll take these points in reverse order before
delving into the implementation.</p>
<h1 id="consuming-transit-data">Consuming Transit Data</h1>
<p>The most common way to address (2) is by consuming a source that
adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit">GTFS</a> (General Transit Feed Specification), the
defacto standard for transit data that is published by many transit
agencies. It has complementary <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">static</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime">realtime</a> flavors, and we need both sources to get the
most accurate data for our dashboard.</p>
<p>To better understand the complexity of GTFS, this is a (very rough)
entity relationship diagram:</p>
<a href="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd.svg">
  <img src="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd.svg" alt="GTFS ERD" width="600" />
</a>
<p>Note that there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117174415/http://www.dft.gov.uk/transmodel/schema/doc/GoogleTransit/TransmodelForGoogle-09.pdf">other similar ERDs</a> that are
likely better-researched but didn't fit quite as nealy into this post
so I took a stab at creating this diagram myself. There are a few
caveats in the image above: There are a lot of conditional
relationships in GTFS that are not captured in this image; similarly,
there are also a number of nested entities in the realtime spec that
are glossed over in this diagram for simplicity.</p>
<p>GTFS is quite normalized so there isn't an obvious self-contained
single entity we can read that will let us drive everything in our
dashboard.  Combing through the GTFS entities, there is a sizable
number that are not relevant to displaying transit times at a chosen
station. Removing entities related to fare calculation, pathing,
language translation, station layout, and so forth, the resulting
trimmed-down ERD looks like:</p>
<a href="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd-small.svg">
  <img src="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd-small.svg" alt="GTFS ERD Small" width="300" />
</a>
<p>This subset of the GTFS is a bit more manageable for demonstrating
what we need to consume for our dashboard. The particular relevant
subset might be different for other agencies (e.g., some agencies
might rely more on <code>frequency</code>-based service or have <code>calendar</code>-based
service changes) but this is all I needed based on the <a href="https://mta.info/">MTA</a> GTFS.</p>
<p>Exploring this subset in more detail, the <code>agency</code> entity isn't
strictly necessary except in cases where the feed represents multiple
agencies. To populate the dashboard, we will identify one or more
<code>stops</code>, use these stops to filter the <code>stop times</code> list which allows
us to compute the arrival times at a given stop. This would be
sufficient for our dashboard if there's a single transit line going in
a single direction at a given stop. However, if there's multiple
routes or directions of travel at a particular stop then we need to
split the <code>stop times</code> into groups by direction and route to
differentiate them. To accomplish this, we additionally look up the
<code>trip</code> for each <code>stop time</code> which gives us information about the trip
direction, and then walk through <code>trips</code> to <code>routes</code> which allows us
bucket the <code>stop times</code> into groups by route.</p>
<p>So far, we've only touched the entities in the static GTFS, which is
sufficient if the agency consistency runs on time (ðŸ¤£). To bring the
prescheduled <code>stop times</code> into alignment with reality, we read the
<code>trip updates</code> Realtime source and (hand-waving a lot here) update the
<code>stop times</code> with these realtime updates at a reasonable interval.</p>
<p>At a high-level, this is our roadmap for reading the subset of the
GTFS that we need for this dashboard.</p>
<h1 id="serving-transit-data">Serving Transit Data</h1>
<p>Stepping backwards to address point (1) above, we need to talk about
how we physically convey GTFS data into our web application. The
static portion of the GTFS is a zip file containing <code>.txt</code> files
(effectively CSV formatted)--not impossible to download directly from
the transit agency into a web application with the right
<a href="https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/">decompression</a> and <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">parsing</a> libraries, but hardly
idiomatic. The GTFS Realtime format is even more challenging as it is
serialized as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol Buffer</a>. It <em>might</em> be theoretically
possible to consume the realtime ProtoBuf stream by providing the
<code>.proto</code> file to the browser and using a <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/pbf">ProtoBuf javascript
decoder</a>; in practice, the real-time updates from the <a href="https://api.mta.info/">MTA</a> are megabytes-to-gigabytes and are updated frequently enough
that I had concerns as to whether a cheap, wall-mounted tablet would
be able to handle parsing the feeds in-browser at a reasonable
frequency.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are multiple server-side options available which
vary in quality, completeness, and implementation language. Choosing a
minimal GTFS server could absolutely work for this use case, but I
ultimately ended up gravitating towards the <a href="https://www.opentripplanner.org/">Open Trip Planner</a>
(OTP) project which specializes in route planning (including surface
street connections using <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>). Not only does OTP consume
GTFS (both static and realtime) for use in its route planning, it
caches the serialized results for faster reloading, has a fetching
mechanism to pull the feeds in at a regular cadence, and--most
importantly for our intended application--has an <a href="http://dev.opentripplanner.org/apidoc/1.0.0/resource_IndexAPI.html">Index API</a> which
provides a REST interface to query GTFS entities. Even better, it is
becoming increasingly common for transit agencies themselves to host
an OTP instance for their route planning or transit time needs--if
such an instance is public-facing, using it saves a lot of work
configuring and hosting our own OTP instance.</p>
<p>The discussion from the previous section roughly translates to the
following Clojure pseudocode to walk through the GTFS entities and
collect a useful payload:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(defn stop-times
  [stop-id]
  (-&gt;&gt; stop-id
       fetch-stop
       fetch-stop-times
       (map (fn [stop-time]
              (let [trip  (fetch-trip (:trip-id stop-time))
                    route (fetch-route (:route-id trip))]
                (assoc stop-time
                       :route route
                       :direction (:direction trip)))))))
</code></pre>
<p>Following this, we can <code>concat</code> all the <code>stop-times</code> from all the
<code>stop-id</code>s together and do a <code>(group-by #(select-keys % [:direction :route]))</code> to bundle them into the rows displayed in the dashboard.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://dev.opentripplanner.org/apidoc/1.0.0/resource_IndexAPI.html">Index API</a>, the following endpoints look promising to meet
these needs:</p>
<table>
<thead></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>stop</td><td><code>/index/stops/{stop-id}</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>stop times</td><td><code>/index/stops/{stop-id}/stoptimes</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>trip</td><td><code>/index/trips/{trip-id}</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>route</td><td><code>/index/routes/{route-id}</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As it turns out, the Index API is able to flatten the <code>trip</code> into the
<code>stop</code> entity (<code>/index/stops/{stop-id}</code>) for us in the scenario where
the stop services a single line + direction. This does not initially
sound like a very useful optimization for more complex transit systems
that routinely have multiple routes traveling multiple directions that
stop at the same station. However, in the case of the MTA's GTFS, the
agency choose to model stations hierarchically, where the main station
is the parent stop and different lines+directions are child stops
within the same overall station. The Index API also directly adds the
<code>route-id</code> to the individual <code>stop times</code> (i.e., it traverses the
<code>stop-time -&gt; trip</code> entities for us). Thus by choosing these &quot;child&quot;
stops that represent a single line + direction, we can save having to
make the additional <code>trip</code> call to get the direction + route ID. Under
this optimization assumption we get an even trimmer effective ERD:</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd-smaller.svg"> <img
  src="/img/posts/cockpit/gtfs-erd-smaller.svg" alt="GTFS ERD Smaller"
  width="300" /> </a></p>
<p>Depending on your particular agency, this optimization may not be
applicable or might be overkill if you're hosting your own OTP and
don't have any concerns about the number of API queries. If
self-hosting, this might be a good candidate for the <a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/">BFF</a> pattern,
but the rest of this post assumes a preexisting OTP instance without
any extra server-side components on top of it.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>Now that we've settled on the physical API to use and know the
relationships among the entities we need for our dashboard, all we
have left is to code and style it. Rather than go line-by-line as in
previous installments, I'll only be going over the highlights of the
<a href="https://github.com/malloc47/cockpit/blob/d4badb7e652014693574063806a8ccda27d9fa36/src/cljs/cockpit/transit.cljs">source code</a> in this section.</p>
<p>As with other external APIs we need to hit, we use
<a href="https://github.com/day8/re-frame-http-fx">re-frame-http-fx</a> for defining the &quot;effect handlers&quot; that made the
side-effecting REST calls. An example where we fetch the <code>stop-times</code>
(assumes that the <code>stop</code> has already been fetched and is passed as
input):</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::fetch-stop-times
 (fn [_ [_ {:keys [stop-id] :as stop}]]
   {:http-xhrio
    (merge
     otp-request
     {:uri        (str config/otp-uri
                       &quot;/routers/default/index/stops/&quot;
                       stop-id
                       &quot;/stoptimes&quot;)
      :on-success [::persist-stop-times [:transit :stop-times stop]]
      :on-failure [::events/http-fail [:transit :stop-times stop]]})}))
</code></pre>
<p>The notable part of this effect handler is the <code>::persist-stop-times</code>
event which is dispatched when the effect handler is successful. The
<code>::persist-stop-times</code> event is, itself an effect handler that
persists the <code>stop-times</code> API payload into the <code>re-frame.db/app-db</code>
while also fanning out (<code>:dispatch-n</code>) to trigger <code>::fetch-route</code>
events for all the new <code>route-ids</code> that it finds:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::persist-stop-times
 (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ key-path stop-times]]
   (let [existing-route-ids (-&gt; db :transit :routes keys set)
         new-route-ids      (-&gt;&gt; stop-times :route :id set)
         ;; diff what is in the DB with the newly-seen routes so we
         ;; only fetch them once
         route-ids          (-&gt;&gt; (difference new-route-ids
                                             existing-route-ids)
                                 (remove nil?))
         stop-id            (-&gt; key-path last :stop-id)]
     {:db         (assoc-in db key-path stop-times)
      ;; fire requests for the routes listed in the payload
      :dispatch-n (map (fn [route-id]
                         [::fetch-route route-id])
                       route-ids)})))
</code></pre>
<p>The route-fetching events are fired after fetching the stop times
because the routes that serve a particular stop might change at any
given point so we don't necessarily know all the routes ahead of time.
And it would be better not to have to preemptively fetch every route
in the system, particularly for larger agencies like the MTA. We also
want to avoid re-fetching the same routes over and over again, so
<code>route-ids</code> that are already present in the <code>app-db</code> are not fetched
again to minimize API queries, effectively treating the <code>app-db</code> as a
cache.</p>
<p>How the <code>stop</code> and <code>route</code> entities are persisted is less interesting
so I'm omitting examples of them here. Just like the <a href="/building-a-personal-dashboard-in-clojurescript-part-2">weather
API</a> prior, we now need only to <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/cockpit/blob/d4badb7e652014693574063806a8ccda27d9fa36/src/cljs/cockpit/polling.cljs#L27-L37">poll the
transit
API</a>
at regular intervals to make sure our <code>app-db</code> always has fresh
information ready for display.</p>
<p>Like other re-frame applications, now that we have our events defined
we need to create subscriptions on the resulting <code>app-db</code> changes to
turn these raw OTP Index API payloads into a processed form ready to
be used by our view. Our &quot;Level 1&quot; subscriptions are fairly simple:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(re-frame/reg-sub
 ::stop-times-raw
 (fn [db _]
   (-&gt; db :transit :stop-times)))
;;; Repeat for stops and routes...
</code></pre>
<p>which fetches the raw API payload for the <code>stop-times</code>, which looks
something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">[{:route {:id &quot;MTASBWY:1&quot;}
  :times
  [{:departureDelay     0
    :stopName           &quot;South Ferry&quot;
    :scheduledDeparture 89130
    :stopId             &quot;MTASBWY:142N&quot;
    :directionId        &quot;0&quot;
    :serviceDay         1592539200
    :tripId             &quot;MTASBWY:5953&quot;
    :realtimeDeparture  89130
    :stopHeadsign       &quot;Uptown &amp; The Bronx&quot;
    :tripHeadsign       &quot;Van Cortlandt Park - 242 St&quot;}]
    ...}
 ...]
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>realtimeDeparture</code> field which is updated by OTP with the
GTFS Realtime source.  This payload goes through a cleanup
subscription that grabs specific keys from the payload, places them
into a flattened data structure, and converts the fixed departure
timestamp into a &quot;minutes from now&quot; format that we'll want in our
view:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(re-frame/reg-sub
 ::stop-times
 :&lt;- [::stop-times-raw]
 :&lt;- [::clock/clock]
 (fn [[stop-times clock] _]
   (let [now (time-coerce/from-date clock)]
     (-&gt;&gt; stop-times
          vals
          (apply concat)
          (mapcat
           (fn [{:keys [times route]}]
             (-&gt;&gt; times
                  (map #(assoc % :route route))
                  (map
                   (fn [{time           :realtimeDeparture
                         day            :serviceDay
                         stop-id        :stopId
                         {route-id :id} :route
                         direction-id   :directionId}]
                     {:minutes        (-&gt; time (+ day) (* 1e3)
                                          time-coerce/from-long
                                          (-&gt;&gt; (safe-interval now))
                                          time/in-seconds
                                          (/ 60)
                                          js/Math.ceil)

                      :direction-id   direction-id})))))))))
</code></pre>
<p>This subscription code is detailed and has some assorted helpers
(<code>safe-interval</code>, the <code>cljs-time</code> namespaces) that are significant but
not worth a tangent right now. As before, I'm also omitting similar
cleanup subscriptions for the <code>stop</code> and <code>route</code> payloads.</p>
<p>Finally, we join all three of <code>stops</code>, <code>stop-times</code>, and <code>routes</code>
together with a 3rd-level subscription:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(re-frame/reg-sub

                       (comp :stop-id :stop first))))))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a <em>lot</em> to unpack, especially compared with the pseudocode
above (which probably means this code needs some refactoring into more
subscriptions); out of laziness, I'll just summarize the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep only <code>stop-times</code> that are less than 60 minutes out</li>
<li>The <code>stop</code> and <code>route</code> are attached to the <code>stop-time</code> with an inner
join</li>
<li>Group all <code>stop-times</code> by the different <code>stops</code> they represent</li>
<li>Do a &quot;roll up&quot; of all the routes attached to the stop times inside
of each group with the <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/cockpit/blob/d4badb7e652014693574063806a8ccda27d9fa36/src/cljs/cockpit/transit.cljs#L233-L256"><code>roll-up-route</code>
function</a>,
which lets us show a stop, say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue%E2%80%9363rd_Street_station">Lex/63rd</a>,
as a single row labeled &quot;F/Q&quot; rather than having separate rows for
the F and Q lines. This is typically more useful for express lines
or other situations where you care only about the latest departure
but don't care about the particular line.</li>
<li>Filter out mislabeled stop times going the wrong direction at a stop</li>
<li>Sort the stop times in each group in ascending order</li>
<li>Take the first four stop-times in each group to show in the view</li>
<li>Sort the groups themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>We now have a stable, easy-to-consume set of groups corresponding to
all the stops we care about, each with up to four upcoming departure
times in minutes.</p>
<p>This payload is subsequently rendered in the view. Recall that we want
a series of rows in our view that look like:</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/cockpit/transit-row.png"> <img
  src="/img/posts/cockpit/transit-row.png" alt="Transit row"
  width="300" /> </a></p>
<p>where the arrow specifies the direction of travel, the round symbol
specifies the particular route name, and the stop times fan out to the
right. This is rendered with:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(defn transit []
  [:&gt; Card {:height &quot;48vh&quot;}
   [:&gt; CardContent

      (fn [[{{:keys [color text-color short-name route-id]} :route
             {:keys [direction-id stop-id]} :stop}
            stop-times]]
        ;; Since this element is being dynamically generated, must
        ;; specify key so React can do its reconcilliation
        [:&lt;&gt; {:key (str stop-id &quot;-&quot; route-id)}

         ;; Arrow pointing up or down corresponding to the direction

           short-name]]

         ;; Render the stop
         (-&gt;&gt; (concat stop-times (repeat nil))
              (map-indexed
               (fn [idx {:keys [minutes] :as stop-time}]
                 [:&lt;&gt; {:key idx}
                  [:&gt; Grid {:item true :xs 2}
                   (when stop-time
                     [:&gt; Typography
                      [:span
                       (if (&gt; minutes 0)
                         [:&lt;&gt; minutes [:span &quot;m &quot;]]
                         &quot;Now &quot;)]])]]))
              (take 4))

         [:&gt; Grid {:item true :xs 1}]])
      @(re-frame/subscribe [::transit/stop-times-processed]))]]])
</code></pre>
<p>This is another beast of a function (and I omitted some styling just
to trim it down this small), but broken down is not too complicated:
The outer <code>map</code> generates a row where each row consists of the up/down
arrow and a circular <code>Avatar</code> symbol with the line <code>short-name</code> to
display the route. The inner <code>map-indexed</code> generates exactly 4 stop
times (or empty <code>Grid</code> items to pad out the grid).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Since this the final post in the series, I would be remiss not to
include some photos of the finished product:</p>

<p>Differing slightly from the <a href="/building-a-personal-dashboard-in-clojurescript">first installment</a>, I've since replaced
the stock chart in the lower right with a webcam view from <a href="https://nyc.gov/dot">NYC DOT</a>
but kept the appearance otherwise unchanged.</p>
<p>The dashboard is displayed on an inexpensive, previous-generation
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Previous-Generation-9th/dp/B0794RHPZD">Amazon Fire 8</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/thanksmister/wallpanel-android">WallPanel</a> app (having switched away
from <a href="https://www.fully-kiosk.com/">Fully Kiosk</a> for this open-source option) to keep the
ClojureScript SPA running continually. To physically affix the tablet
to the wall, I purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BX5YWF4/">tablet wall mount</a> which adheres using
Command Strips. A wall-colored Micro USB cable to keep the tablet
charged completes the installation.</p>
<p>So far, this setup has been working well. There are some minor
annoyances with the hardware: This particular Fire tablet does not
make ambient light adjustments to the screen brightness so it lightens
my living room considerably at night. Given that this tablet is a full
order of magnitude cheaper than the premium tablet options, it has
been more than sufficient for this purpose and I won't be overly upset
by battery or screen burn-in issues long-term.</p>
