    <header><a href="/10000-commits/">10,000 Commits</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Since finishing my dissertation, I decided to gather some metrics
across the related repositories. Pulling the raw number of commits
with (roughly) this:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">find . -name .git
    | xargs -I {} git --git-dir={} log
                      --all
                      --author=$(whoami)
                      --pretty=format:&quot;%H&quot;
    | sort | uniq | wc -l
</code></pre>
<p>I realized that I'd crossed the 10,000 commit threshold right before
graduating. Which seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>While the Gladwellian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hours</a> heuristic (debatable as it may
be) for mastering a craft fits as a general cross-discipline measure,
I'd conjecture 10,000 commits is a more fitting measure for software
engineers. It's difficult to imagine reaching 10,000 commits without
having gone through a full software lifecycle, probably more than
once. And counting commits instead of hours has the advantage of each
being a visible, presumably atomic, and (lightly) documented bit of
work, where the prerequisite (actually using/understanding version
control) is a good indicator of investment in the craft. For those of
us who may have exceeded 10,000 hours tinkering with &quot;programming&quot;
before finishing high school, having a goal that requires the
discipline to document your progress may be more helpful than 10,000
unstructured or undocumented hours of hacking.</p>
<p>Particularly when completing a CS Ph.D., commits to research software,
open source patches, version controlled manuscripts, research
notebooks, etc.---when taken together---are rarely going to number
much less than 10,000 if you've truly produced enough work to
graduate.  Similarly, though I've not stayed in a junior software
developer role long enough to be promoted, crossing the 10,000
threshold sounds more than ample evidence of outgrowing the role.</p>
<p>When a software project hits 10,000 commits---no matter how ugly it
might be---it's easy to imagine it being fleshed-out and mature.  I'd
like to think engineers might be too.</p>

    <header><a href="/latex-snippet-literal-one-liners/">LaTeX Snippet: (Literal) One Liners</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>There are some truly <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/33417/adjust-font-size-on-the-fly">impressive</a> LaTeX solutions for doing
PowerPoint-style font-resizing to fit into a fixed width box.  I
recently had need of something more simple: print text on <em>one line
only</em>, scaling the size down instead of allowing it to wrap.  The
following LaTeX snippet does exactly this, triggered only if the font
width (before wrapping) exceeds <code>\textwidth</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="latex">{
  \def\formattedtext{The no-wrap text to scale}%
  \newdimen{\namewidth}%
  \setlength{\namewidth}{\widthof{\formattedtext}}%
  \ifthenelse{\lengthtest{\namewidth &lt; \textwidth}}%
  {\formattedtext}% do nothing if shorter than text width
  {\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\formattedtext}}% scale down
}
</code></pre>
<p>This requires</p>
<pre><code class="latex">\usepackage{xifthen}
\usepackage{graphicx}
</code></pre>
<p>to handle the <code>\ifthenelse</code>, <code>\lengthtest</code>, and <code>\resizebox</code>
statements.</p>
<p>It works like you might expect: check the width of the text, and then
use <code>\resizebox</code> to scale it down, if needed.  Such logic isn't always
obvious in LaTeX: arbitrary <code>def</code>s cannot store length information, so
you have to set the type of the <code>\namewidth</code> variable as a dimension
before you can assign/test it as a length.</p>
<p>As with most helpful things in LaTeX, we can wrap it up in a reusable
macro:</p>
<pre><code class="latex">\newcommand{\oneline}[1]{{&quot;{%&quot; }}
  \newdimen{\namewidth}%
  \setlength{\namewidth}{\widthof{#1}}%
  \ifthenelse{\lengthtest{\namewidth &lt; \textwidth}}%
  {#1}%
  {\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{#1}}%
}
</code></pre>
<p>which allows</p>
<pre><code class="latex">\oneline{\Huge{The no-wrap text to scale}}

\oneline{\Huge{The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, over and over and over and over again.}}
</code></pre>
<p>On any reasonable-sized page width, these two lines will not wrap, but
the longer line will be stretched horizontally to fit in the available space.</p>
<p>You can find a fully-working (as of TeXLive 2012) gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/malloc47/5298181">here</a>.</p>

    <header><a href="/tech-company-locations/">Tech Company Locations (North America)</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Since I'm soon to be on the technology job market, I decided to get
a handle on where the major technology companies were located.  After
spending some quality time going back and forth bettween the "Career"
sections of different companies and Google Maps, I assembled this:</p>
<iframe width="620" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="//maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=208032600690328075247.0004d67c37273c82e2363&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=33.578015,-96.767578&amp;spn=34.833124,56.25&amp;z=4&amp;output=embed"></iframe>
<p>There are a number of disclaimers here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is geared primarily toward locations that emphasize
    software engineering roles.  I tried to filter accordingly if there
    are few/no engineering jobs listed for a paricular location, but
    that may not be perfect either.</li>
  <li>Few companies provided the exact address (Microsoft being one of
    the exceptions) for every one of their locations, so if Google
    Maps searches failed, then I just approximated.</li>
  <li>This is certainly not exhaustive; many companies (namely Amazon)
    have many subsidiaries under different branding, which may or may
    not have any engineering roles.</li>
  <li>This doesn't include data centers, retail stores, etc.</li>
</ul>

    <header><a href="/laptops-are-the-stenotypes-of-software-engineers/">Laptops are the Stenotypes of Software Engineers</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Increasingly, I've been asked variants on the question &quot;what will
happen to desktops/laptops,&quot; particularly in light of the
proliferation of smartphones and tablets.  This has resulted in
several good conversations, and I've begun to use the following
analogy when discussing this with colleagues in non-engineering
disciplines:</p>
<p>Laptop computers will become the stenotypes of software engineers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype">stenotype</a> is a niche device used by stenographers (most
prominently, court reporters) to transcribe dialog in real-time at
blindingly-fast words-per-minute rates.  Fellow Emacs users might
appreciate how the stenotype works: instead of typing single letters,
multiple keys are &quot;chorded&quot; together to allow many more combinations
with many fewer keys.  And instead of producing single letters, many
of these combinations produce syllables or whole words.  These
physical optimizations are coupled with conventions among
stenographers to wantonly omit or abbreviate words where there is
little ambiguity of meaning, which further improves efficiency---the
fewer characters put to a page, the less chance of typos.  This leads
to the output of the stenotype being difficult to read by those who
are not well-versed in the conventions (called &quot;theories&quot;) used by
stenographers.</p>
<p>One could describe the typical QWERTY keyboard as the antithesis of
the stenotype.  Designed to reduce jams in the old typewriting
systems---a constraint clearly nonexistent in modern
hardware---mainstream keyboards are considered more accessible
compared with a stenotype.  However, even considering later
iterations, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a> layout, these keyboards cannot
hope to match the ruthless efficiency of a stenotype when used in
real-time transcription work.</p>
<p>Few would reach for a stenotype to write a letter to their mother
(unless she was a stenographer herself!), and no trained court
reporter would care to wonder into the courtroom with a QWERTY
keyboard.  Despite digital recorders making inroads into court
reporting and closed caption transcription, stenotypes are still
available (hint: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=stenotype&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40">ebay</a>), persisting thanks to an ingrained base of
stenographers who remain ruthlessly efficient at these
highly-specialized tasks.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to computing.</p>
<p>Software engineers are not your average user.  We don't have an
average computing workload and have a completely disparate set of
tools and conventions.  Dell didn't even try to lampshade this fact
with their <a href="https://content.dell.com/us/en/gen/d/campaigns/xps-linux-laptop">Sputnik</a> Ubuntu laptop aimed squarely at developers.
And, while tablets have proven to be capable of everything from
typical computing tasks to <a href="https://pythonforios.com/">basic software development</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it doesn't have a keyboard, I feel that my thoughts are being
forced out through a straw.<br />
---Joey Hess</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3004563/2013-when-tablets-beat-laptops">immanent death</a> of the laptop is greatly exaggerated; after
all, the stenotype lives on to this day.  However, the fate of the
laptop <em>as we know it</em>---available in every imaginable color, style,
shape, size, and brandishing shiny logos to reinforce its reputation
as a status symbol---is less certain.  This fact was made more stark
for me when I realized that installing <a href="https://www.android-x86.org/">Android x86</a> on my Eee PC
gave it more in common with modern computing platforms than my primary
development laptop (Thinkpad x120e with Arch Linux and the minimal
xmonad window manager).  And I know I'm not the only developer who
has, consciously or unconsciously, increased the specialization of my
desktops/laptops while using smartphones/tablets for non-work related
activities.  Who really wants to pull out and boot up a laptop for
light internet reading when you've got an instant-on smartphone or
tablet within reach?  I'm becoming more convinced that this is what
the real &quot;death&quot; of the laptop looks like.</p>
<p>For software engineers, the role of laptops (and desktops even moreso)
is slowly morphing into one similar to that of stenotypes.  It's
arguable that this is inevitable: artists don't use college-rule
paper, chemists don't conduct titrations in a coffee mug, and
firefighters don't roll up in a corolla to put out house fires.
Professions evolve better and more efficient methodology, and when
professionals outgrow the prevailing tools available to consumers,
they develop new tools.  This has already been well underway on the
software side---you won't find lawyers writing briefs with <code>vim</code>,
after all.</p>
<p>If consumer computing devices become more recalcitrant for software
engineers, it makes sense that a professional-grade tool should fill
in the gap.  The most natural candidate is the form factors we already
have: laptops and desktops.  But that certainly doesn't limit
innovation to current devices---a positive side effect of this &quot;death&quot;
of laptops is that it provides a great opportunity to rethink what
sort of device would benefit developers most, without being strictly
constrained by a 1980s design that was intended for general computing.
And this prospect may not be as far away as it might seem, given the
recent rise of <a href="https://www.hackthings.com/brace-yourself-here-come-the-hardware-startups/">hardware startups</a>.</p>
<p>The next time you pull out a laptop in a coffee shop, I don't
anticipate you'll get the same quizzical looks you might receive if
you brought a stenotype with you.  But, like the stenotype, I do think
that the proliferation of tablets and other more consumer-oriented
devices will necessitate a professional class of devices that are less
common and more specialized.  And in the meantime, that might mean the
stylishness of laptops will begin to wane.  I'm okay with that.</p>
<p>[Incidentally, you can turn a conventional keyboard into a stenotype-like device with <a href="https://stenoknight.com/wiki/Main_Page">Plover</a>,
an open-source stenotype software package.]</p>

    <header><a href="/producing-latex-from-numpy-arrays/">Producing LaTeX from NumPy Arrays</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>For my comprehensive exam, I needed to quickly convert some NumPy
arrays into nice-looking LaTeX <code>array</code> elements.  The TeX Stack
Exchange site has a good <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/54990/convert-numpy-array-into-tabular">answer</a> for <code>tabular</code> environments, but
wasn't quite suited to the <code>array</code> environment.  The usual answer here
would be <a href="https://mpastell.com/pweave/">Pweave</a> but, being short on time, I ended up rolling my
own function instead:</p>
<pre><code class="python">def to_latex(a,label='A'):
    sys.stdout.write('\[ '
                     + label
                     + ' = \\left| \\begin{array}{'
                     + ('c'*a.shape[1])
                     + '}\n' )
    for r in a:
        sys.stdout.write(str(r[0]))
        for c in r[1:]:
            sys.stdout.write(' &amp; '+str(c))
        sys.stdout.write('\\\\\n')
    sys.stdout.write('\\end{array} \\right| \]\n')
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an incomplete snippet of it in action, where I convolve an
array <code>t</code> with four different filters, producing a latex formula for
each result:</p>
<pre><code class="python">filters = (('A \\oplus H_1',h1)
           , ('A \\oplus H_2',h2)
           , ('A \\oplus H_3',h3)
           , ('A \\oplus H_4',h4))

for label,f in filters:
    t2 = scipy.signal.convolve(t,f,'same')
    to_latex(t2.astype('uint8'),label=label)
</code></pre>
<p>I'll likely get around to expanding this into a full package sometime
in the future, since there's a lot that is hard coded (the <code>\[ \]</code>
environment, stringification of the array, the fact that all columns
are centered, etc.).  A gist of the function is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/4665827">here</a>.</p>
