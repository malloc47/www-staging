    <header><a href="/google-completion-in-emacs/">Google Completion in Emacs</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>While many an <code>emacs</code> include <code>dabbrev-expand</code> for within-buffer
completion, I've always wanted (purely for reasons of amusement) to
take it further: completion via Google's search suggestions.  I was
going to do this as a weekend project, but an ugly version was
surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>curl</code> is all we need to fetch the completions for a
query string as <code>JSON</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">&gt; echo -en $(curl -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; \
  &quot;https://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&amp;q=query&quot;)

[&quot;query&quot;,[&quot;query&quot;,&quot;query xiv&quot;,&quot;query letter&quot;,&quot;query_posts&quot;,&quot;query shark&quot;,&quot;query access&quot;,&quot;query tracker&quot;,&quot;query string&quot;,&quot;query letter sample&quot;,&quot;queryperformancecounter&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<p>using a (very platform dependent) <code>echo</code> trick to convert the escaped
unicode sequences to their proper characters.</p>
<p>With this, a quick hack in <code>elisp</code> is all that's necessary to parse
the results into <code>emacs</code> and insert it into the current buffer:</p>
<pre><code class="cl">(defun google-request (query)
 (shell-command-to-string
  (format
   &quot;echo -en $(curl -H \&quot;Accept: application/json\&quot; \&quot;https://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&amp;q=%s\&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;
   query)))

(defun google-preprocess (query)
 (let ((l (split-string
	   (apply 'string
		  (removel
		   '(?\&quot; ?\[ ?\])
		   (string-to-list query)))
	   &quot;,&quot;)))
  (if (&gt; (length (car (cdr l))) 0)
    (remove (car l) (cdr l))
   nil)))

(defun google-complete ()
 (interactive)
 (end-of-thing 'word)
 (let ((s (thing-at-point 'word)))
  (when s
   (let ((q (google-preprocess (google-request s))))
    (when q
     (insert (substring
	       (car q)
	       (length s))))))))

(defun removel (el l)
 (cond (el (removel (cdr el) (remove (car el) l)))
       (t l)))
</code></pre>
<p>Since it went more swiftly than anticipated, I generalized the code to
parsing any delimited shell output and wrapped it in a minor mode with
some key bindings and <code>customize</code> variables.  Right now, I'm
uncreatively calling it <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/shell-parse.el/blob/master/shell-parse.el"><code>shell-parse.el</code></a>.</p>
<p>After activating <code>shell-parse-mode</code>, it has support for scrolling
through the list of completions forwards (<code>shell-parse-complete</code>) and
backwards (<code>shell-parse-complete-backwards</code>) with the <code>C-Tab</code> and
<code>C-Shift-Tab</code> keys, respectively.  Using <code>M-x customize-mode &lt;Enter&gt; shell-parse-mode</code>, you can swap out the <code>curl</code> command with any shell
snippet that will kick back completions, and change the delimiter as
well.</p>
<p>You can grab <code>shell-parse.el</code> on <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/shell-parse.el">github</a>.  Simply <code>load-file</code> the
<code>shell-parse.el</code> script in <code>.emacs</code> and it should be ready to go.</p>
<p>It has a few todos scattered through it yet, and is not very idiomatic
<code>emacs</code> or portable, but that's what github's <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/shell-parse.el/issues">issue tracker</a> is
for, after all.</p>

    <header><a href="/preprocessors-and-graphviz/">Preprocessors and Graphviz</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p><code>Graphviz</code> is a useful toolset for describing and rendering graphs.
One of the features the graphviz language doesn't have, however, is a
<code>C</code>-like preprocessor to <code>#include</code> files.  Which, granted, isn't a
particularly common use case when building graphs, but one I found
desirable when dealing with a large number of graphs with a shared
subset of nodes, differing by how they are connected.</p>
<p>Initially, I grafted together an unwieldy <a href="https://gist.github.com/2324425">script</a> that used an
ugly <code>grep</code>+<code>sed</code> combination to grab the line number and substitute
the included file contents: essentially a poor man's preprocessor.
Thankfully, to the rescue was a particularly useful <a href="https://gist.github.com/2037497">gist</a>
(initially illustrated with JavaScript) I serendipitously found
on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/qxn73/mixing_javascript_and_the_cpreprocessor/">Reddit</a>. The key call being this:</p>
<pre><code>cpp -P -undef -Wundef -std=c99 -nostdinc -Wtrigraphs \
    -fdollars-in-identifiers -C &lt; input.dot &gt; output.dot
</code></pre>
<p>In your input <code>.dot</code> file, standard <code>C</code> include syntax</p>
<pre><code class="c">#include &quot;common.doth&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>will work as expected, despite the fact that it is a completely
different language.</p>
<p>This solution is highly verbose if you don't drop it in a build chain
and forget about it.  Which is straightforward using a standard
<a href="https://github.com/open-it-lab/ol-curriculum/blob/master/makefile">makefile</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="make">SOURCES = $(wildcard *.dot)
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.dot=.doto)
IMAGES  = $(SOURCES:.dot=.png)

all: $(IMAGES)

%.png: %.doto
	dot -Tpng $&lt; &gt; $@

%.doto: %.dot
	cpp -P -undef -Wundef -std=c99 -nostdinc -Wtrigraphs \
		-fdollars-in-identifiers -C &lt; $&lt; | \
		gvpr -c 'N[$$.degree==0]{delete(NULL,$$)}' &gt; $@

clean:
	-rm $(IMAGES) $(OBJECTS) *~
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, I introduced an intermediate <code>doto</code> file
(analogous to an object file) and <code>doth</code> (header file) to recreate a
<code>C</code>-like build process.</p>
<p>Another ingredient above is the piped invocation of <code>gvpr</code>, which
removes nodes of degree 1 (so that included nodes that are not
attached to anything in the current file will be ignored).  Remember
that in <code>makefiles</code>, the <code>$</code> must be escaped by using
<code>$$</code>. Unfortunately, the <code>delete</code> function in <code>gvpr</code> is <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=652952">broken</a> in
a number of Debian-based distros (at least), but the latest version
works bug-free in Arch.</p>
<p>So, given a <code>nodes.doth</code> file with these contents:</p>
<pre><code>    node1 [label = &quot;1&quot;];
    node2 [label = &quot;2&quot;];
    node3 [label = &quot;3&quot;];
</code></pre>
<p>and a <code>graph.dot</code> file as such:</p>
<pre><code>graph g {
    #include &quot;nodes.doth&quot;

    node1 -- node2;
    node2 -- node3;
    node3 -- node1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>makefile</code> will use <code>cpp</code> to generate the following intermediate
file,</p>
<pre><code>graph g {
    node1 [label = &quot;1&quot;];
    node2 [label = &quot;2&quot;];
    node3 [label = &quot;3&quot;];
    node1 -- node2;
    node2 -- node3;
    node3 -- node1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>which will then be compiled by graphviz's <code>dot</code> command into an image.
While obviously not necessary with this toy example, scaling up to
more nodes shared by multiple graphs is much more pleasant when the
nodes don't have to be duplicated in each graph.</p>
<p>Very little of this is exclusive to graphviz, and is reasonable to
extrapolate to other problems fairly easily.  And, since this
literally uses the <code>C</code> preprocessor to do the job, there's many more
tricks to be explored.</p>
<p>Quite helpful to have on hand when the need arises, and a testament to
the quality of <code>cpp</code> that it can be used for arbitrary metaprogramming
in other languages.</p>

    <header><a href="/qr-codes-en-masse/">QR Codes En Masse</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>For the upcoming <a href="https://www.posscon.org/">POSSCON</a> here in Columbia, we had need of QR
codes for the brochure.  Lots of them.  And while there are
<a href="https://qrcode.kaywa.com/">some</a>
<a href="https://goqr.me/">great</a>
<a href="https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/qrgen/">online</a>
resources,
I wanted to create QR codes in batch.</p>
<p>Of course, the online services could be batch processed with a dose
of <code>curl</code> magic, but there is a more UNIX way: <code>libqrencode</code>.</p>
<p>Creating a discrete QR code image is straightforward with the
<code>qrencode</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>qrencode -o output.png -s 50 &quot;https://www.malloc47.com&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s</code> parameter controls the size of the QR &quot;dots&quot; and therefore
the output resolution.</p>
<p>This is great if you don't need a vectorized format, but for
print-quality work where you may not know the eventual <code>DPI</code>, having
vectorized output (e.g. <code>eps</code>, and <code>svg</code>) is preferable.</p>
<p>Again, the vast repositories of libre software come to the rescue
here: <code>potrace</code> is designed for exactly this.  Annoyingly, it only
handles bitmap (or the easy-to-generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">pnm</a>) format, so a little
<code>imagemagick</code> will take care of this:</p>
<pre><code>convert output.png output.bmp
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can convert to a vector format easily:</p>
<pre><code>potrace -e -o output.eps output.bmp # -e is for EPS
potrace -s -o output.svg output.bmp # -s is for SVG
</code></pre>
<p>We can wrap it all up into a nice (<code>bash</code>) script:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
set -e
qrencode -o $1.png -s 50 &quot;$2&quot;
convert $1.png $1.bmp
potrace -e -o $1.eps $1.bmp
rm $1.png $1.bmp
</code></pre>
<p>which takes a file name prefix and a string to be encoded. To generate
a large set of QR codes with this script, simply create a file with
file prefix-<code>URL</code>(or whatever data is to be encoded) pairs, each on a
separate line,</p>
<pre><code>google https://www.google.com
amazon https://www.amazon.com
reddit https://www.reddit.com
....
</code></pre>
<p>and then loop over this file, line-by-line:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">while read line ; do ./create-qr-code.sh $line ; done &lt; list.text
</code></pre>
<p>which conveniently gives us <code>google.eps</code>, <code>amazon.eps</code>, and
<code>reddit.eps</code> files for their respective <code>URL</code>s.</p>
<p>If there is uncertainty that your <code>URL</code>s are good (i.e. don't kick back
<code>404</code>s), then you can augment the above script with this nice <code>curl</code>
snippet (courtesy of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2924422/how-do-i-determine-if-a-web-page-exists-with-shell-scripting">this</a> post on SO):</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
set -e
curl -s --head $2 | head -n 1 | grep &quot;HTTP/1.[01] [23]..&quot; &gt; /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
    qrencode -o $1.png -s 50 &quot;$2&quot;
    convert $1.png $1.bmp
    potrace -e -o $1.eps $1.bmp
    rm $1.png $1.bmp
else
    echo &quot;URL error: $2&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2
fi
</code></pre>
<p>This will let you know which <code>URL</code>s don't come back with clean headers
so you can give them further attention.  It won't capture everything
that might go wrong, but it does give you a programmatic way to verify
that all is well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, all the tools used here can be installed on Arch with</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S qrencode potrace imagemagick curl
</code></pre>
<p>Not exactly the prettiest shell glue, but it certainly beats slowly
copy &amp; pasting in and out of a browser.</p>

    <header><a href="/flirting-with-the-front-end/">Flirting with the Front End</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Every few years, when I'm not teaching introductory web programming, I
revisit front end development, oftentimes in the form of retooling my
site.  Last time, it was a Wordpress-driven theme with
cobbled-together JavaScript snippets for random bits of functionality:</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/flirting-with-the-front-end/old-site.png"><img src="/img/posts/flirting-with-the-front-end/thumb/old-site.jpg" alt="Old Site" width="280" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Serviceable, at least.</p>
<p>Before this, I used a generic Wordpress theme, the specifics of which
I don't recall.  Rolling back all the way to the mid-90s, I had a
<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com">fortunecity</a> site, which was--as typical of sites in the
90s--equal parts bland and garish:</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/flirting-with-the-front-end/older-site.png"><img src="/img/posts/flirting-with-the-front-end/thumb/older-site.jpg" alt="Old Site" width="280" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, it had a Christmas theme for the title page. And yes, the header,
navigation bar, and footer (on individual pages) are all java applets.
Not exactly, a usability panacea.</p>
<p>And now, I've transitioned to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's hard to get faster than static pages for serving content.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> can handle more traffic than the shared hosting I was
using previously.</li>
<li>A Jekyll deploy on github can't use external plugins.  Which is, by
most accounts, a downside, but it forces me to find front-end
solutions for what I want rather than turning to the back end for
everything.</li>
<li>I wanted to build everything from scratch.  The limited <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>
DSL used by Jekyll is leaner than full-blown <code>PHP</code>, and more
satisfying for building from the ground-up (all my Wordpress themes
started from--at minimum--a skeleton theme, just to cover the
essentials needed by Wordpress).</li>
<li>Having everything in a git repo is both satisfying for my current
work flow and avoids the pain of database backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/malloc47.github.com">here</a> it is.  I avoided <code>jQuery</code> (convenient as it is) to keep
things lean and loading quickly, and rampantly bludgeoned the site with
<code>HTML5/CSS3</code> without much regard for backwards compatibility.  To
further optimize queries, I used Liquid <code>include</code>s to aggregate all
the <code>js</code> and <code>css</code> into single files.  For <code>JavaScript</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">---
---
(function () {
    &quot;use strict&quot;;
{{ &quot;{% include cookies.js &quot; }}%}
{{ &quot;{% include mini-clock.js &quot; }}%}
{{ &quot;{% include check-time.js &quot; }}%}
{{ &quot;{% include event-handler.js &quot; }}%}
}());
</code></pre>
<p>you can wrap everything with <code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> to get some extra
exception goodness.  Doing this may cause <a href="https://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> to complain
about indentation issues, and if you don't add event handlers with
JavaScript (e.g. you use the <code>onclick</code> or <code>onload</code> events in your
<code>HTML</code> tags), you may run into scope issues as well.  All of this
together provided a nearly 20-point speed bump on
<a href="https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/">Google page speed</a>.</p>
<p>I opted for a dual-themed site, determined by the time of day.  The
clock drawn in the HTML5 Canvas element in the upper-left shows when
the transition will occur, or you can override it with the icon next
to the clock.</p>
<p>All in all, a good transition so far.</p>

    <header><a href="/jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii-a-coding-retrospective/">Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II -- A coding retrospective</a></header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Years ago, before I got my hands on a real compiler, I satisfied my
coding compulsion by modding <em>Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</em> (which,
yes, has the subtitle backwards from normal). As detailed
<a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3233/adding_languages_to_game_engines.php">elsewhere</a>, Jedi Knight (abbreviated JK) is one of the earlier
examples of a game that used a simple scripting language to handle
interaction with the game engine. COG script, as it was called was, in
hindsight, designed as much to be easy to compile as it was to write.
Of course, the attractive thing to any 13-year-old who desperately
wants to code in a &quot;real&quot; language was COG's (superficial) similarity
to C.</p>
<p>The structure of a COG script is straightforward: it starts with a
<em>symbols</em> section, where all variables are declared, followed
by a <em>code</em> section broken into various messages (denoted by
goto-like labels, which must be declared as variables in the symbol
section to be valid) that represent events that could be triggered
in-game.  Aside from the usual expressions and flow control, there are
library functions that form an elementary API for the game engine
itself. Variables are typed, and have one of two scopes. The &quot;local&quot;
variables are bound within the scope of the script itself.  All
non-local variables must be bound to external entities in the game
environment--think of them as free parameters that must be specified
outside the script. Variable types include a few atomic types (e.g.,
int, flex) and some game-specific entities (e.g., things, surfaces),
and event types (e.g., messages). Have a look:</p>

<p>The above code works as you would expect--it simulates a &quot;ladder&quot; by
simply teleporting the player to the top of the ladder if they
&quot;activate&quot; (by pressing the spacebar while standing near) a surface at
the bottom, or teleports them back down if they activate the ladder
surface at the top.</p>
<p>With no reference whatsoever--beyond the COGs included with the game
itself--it took me a while to get used to writing COG. But given that
it had one of the more fun compilers around (though billed as a
scripting language, COG was actually compiled to a stack-based
language at load-time), I had little trouble finding motivation to toy
with it.</p>
<p>Aside from COG, JK had a variety of other specialized file types that
could be (relatively) easily created or modified: .<em>3do</em> for 3D
models, .<em>mat</em> and <em>.bm</em> for images (bitmaps, essentially), <em>.jk</em> for
level meta information, <em>.pup</em> (puppet) files that link keyframed
animations to specific pose states for a character, <em>.key</em> files which
are the keyframed animations for the characters, <em>.snd</em> files that
link sound to a character, <em>.ai</em> files that expose variables for how
the characters react (simple artificial intelligence), <em>.gob</em> files
which are essentially .zip files for storing all the various resources
in a level, and many many more file types I'm probably forgetting.</p>
<p>But it was always the COGs that were most interesting to me, despite the fact that I wrote some ugly and embarrassing code in it. <a href="https://raw.github.com/malloc47/return-of-thrawn/master/thrawn/cog/forcefield_goal.cog">Really embarrassing</a>.</p>
<p>And I won't even get started on my very unrefined sense of aesthetic
design in the level I ended up building. Yes, I built an entire level,
mainly to facilitate being able to write fun little scripts in
COG. Which is not nearly as involved as it sounds thanks to <a href="https://jkdf2.fandom.com/wiki/JED">JED</a>,
a community-supported level editor. I built a very basic plotline with
a number of cutscenes (9, I claim in the <a href="https://raw.github.com/malloc47/return-of-thrawn/master/thrawn/readme.txt">readme</a>); a weapon mod
that added a phaser to your arsenal (you know, the Star Trek sort--I
never claimed any of this made sense except to my 13-year-old self);
two new types of enemies, as I never thought the original lineup was
difficult enough; a few secret areas, including one with a rather
famous character; a zoo (again, never said anything about making
sense); a few RPG-style quests; and committed some very horrible
texture misuse, a fact that the contemporary <a href="https://tacc.massassi.net/levels/review.php?id=41">reviews</a> will back
up.</p>
<p>I did learn some rather important software engineering lessons along
the way. I recently ran across my issue-tracking system: a notepad
with 50+ pages of bugs and fixes that I did on the level for the year
or so it was in development. Everything from enemies falling through
floors, cutscenes being mistimed, and impossible-to-win scenarios,
were among the issues I recorded. I simply couldn't keep track of the
number of issues I would notice on every playthrough without writing
them down.</p>
<p>On my nostalgic adventure, I decided to actually get Jedi Knight up
and running again. I think my PC was perfectly adequate to run the
game, according to its own system requirements analyzer:</p>
<div class="centered">
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/jk-analyzer.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/jk-analyzer.jpg" alt="Analyzer" width="280" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>Though it was incorrect about the "Windows 95" part.</p>
</div>
<p>Thankfully, a kind soul rewrote the 16-bit installer (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/starwarsjediknightaltinstall/">here</a>) so,
if you happen to have the Jedi Knight CDs on hand, you can actually
install it on a 64-bit Windows (virtual) machine.</p>
<div class="centered">
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/jk-screenshot.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/jk-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cinematic Screenshot" width="280" height="132" /></a></p>
<p>Ah, nostalgia.</p>
</div>
<p>Getting any new level up and running is typically as simple as placing the .gob file in the EPISODES folder. So, of course, I loaded up my old creation. I definitely had a lot of fun as a kid.</p>
<div class="columns">
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/002.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/002.jpg" alt="Screenshot 1" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Completely forgot about the in-game menu system (so you could bypass
the rather dry "Story" cutscene I included, among other things).</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/007.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/007.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>A planetarium. On a star destroyer, for some reason.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/008.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/008.jpg" alt="Screenshot 3" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>The aforementioned zoo.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/011.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/011.jpg" alt="Screenshot 4" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Oddly, I also included a kitchen. Complete with an oven you have to
crawl into to complete a mission objective.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/019.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/019.jpg" alt="Screenshot 5" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>The obligatory "dress up as the enemy to get through a checkpoint"
plot point.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/024.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/024.jpg" alt="Screenshot 6" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>A sewer at the bottom of a detention center. Even star destroyers have
to take care of their waste somehow.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/027.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/027.jpg" alt="Screenshot 7" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Grand Admiral Thrawn himself, wielding a phaser. And fairly deadly at
that--I died a dozen times or so before beating him.</p>
<p><a href="/img/posts/jk/035.png"><img src="/img/posts/jk/thumb/035.jpg" alt="Screenshot 8" width="280" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Barney makes an appearance. And yes, you can obliterate him.</p>
</div>
<p>While my handiwork hasn't aged well (and neither has JK, for that
matter), I've placed the entire monstrosity on my github for
posterity's sake: <a href="https://github.com/malloc47/return-of-thrawn">https://github.com/malloc47/return-of-thrawn</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, COG certainly wasn't the most stretching or important
language I learned (by a long-shot), nor was building my level the
most disciplined software engineering project I've undertaken, but it
was one thing: it was enthralling enough to keep a kid hooked on
coding and building cool things. Before the era of web apps and mobile
apps, or code academies and khan academies, or Scratch and Alice, I
feel rather lucky to have stumbled on something that was
simultaneously fun and empowering. JK wasn't just a game. It was an
ecosystem. It was an IDE. And it was fun.</p>
